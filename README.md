# Welcome To Team Hack!

## What is Team Hack?

This is a cool open source foundation where you can improve your coding skills and non-coding skills that are increasingly required for a new job. We are 100% remote. Monthly we meet up via a Zoom call and talk about projects and ideas we want to code out together. We use this foundation as a place to help ourselves get better at coding especially for the real world, including common projects we have at work like building landing pages, dashboards, admin panels, and more.

Additionally we try out new frameworks and the latest in technologies available to build out our code. Feel free to join us via [https://teamhack.org] (and learn more about us too). Team Hack is affilliated with [JavaScriptLA](https://javascriptla.net), which is a meetup group that meets monthly (also online) and helps people get better at full stack development especially with JavaScript. That said, Team Hack is not limited to just JavaScript the language. We want to use this space to use all sorts of cool languages including **Python**, **Swift**, **Go** and more.

## What Do You Need To Do?

Make sure you sign up for our meetups via [https://teamhack.org]. Next, be sure to follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/teamhackonline) and/or [Instagram](https://instagram.com/teamhackorg), whatever your favorite social platform is; this way you can stay on top of official updates from our team. You'll also want to have a Slack or Discord account.

If you want to join us on Discord, the invite url you can use is: [https://discord.gg/WMBTHXx]. Slack is [https://javascriptla.herokuapp.com]. Our team prefers Discord, but Slack is okay too.

Get comfortable with Git and Github! We'll be using it a lot, so if you are rusty, you'll want to make sure you know how to clone a repo, add a branch, work on a feature, then push the feature back up to said branch and make a pull request. There's more too, but those are the basics for now, and we can go over these concepts in meetings. Meetings are your chance to ask questions and talk to others, as the real work gets done on your own time.

### View Our Coding Guidelines

Go back to the [Team Hack Git Home Page](https://github.com/team-hack) and click [coding-guidelines](https://github.com/team-hack/coding-guidelines), then read the files inside.

Make sure you are good on all the information presented there. These files form the basis for how our group members will conduct themselves as part of Team Hack, as well as reference for what to do when working in projects.

## Final Thoughts

Over time we will be improving all repos, but that's really the gist for now with this file. Feel free to join JavaScriptLA's [Slack](https://javascriptla.herokuapp.com) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/WMBTHXx) if you have more questions, and in time we will have more updates here.
